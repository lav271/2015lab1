Our last king,\\r\\nWhose image even but now appear'd to us,\\r\\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\\r\\nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\\r\\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--\\r\\nFor so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--\\r\\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,\\r\\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\\r\\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,\\r\\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:\\r\\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\\r\\nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd\\r\\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\\r\\nHad he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,\\r\\nAnd carriage of the article design'd,\\r\\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\\r\\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\\r\\nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,\\r\\nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\\r\\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\\r\\nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--\\r\\nAs it doth well appear unto our state,--\\r\\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand,\\r\\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\\r\\nSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,\\r\\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\\r\\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\\r\\nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nBer.\\r\\nI think it be no other but e'en so:\\r\\nWell may it sort, that this portentous figure\\r\\nComes armed through our watch; so like the king\\r\\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\\r\\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\\r\\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\\r\\nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead\\r\\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\\r\\nAs, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\\r\\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\\r\\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,\\r\\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\\r\\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,--\\r\\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates,\\r\\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,--\\r\\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\\r\\nUnto our climature and countrymen.--\\r\\nBut, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Re-enter Ghost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!\\r\\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\\r\\nSpeak to me:\\r\\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\\r\\nThat may to thee do ease, and, race to me,\\r\\nSpeak to me:\\r\\nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,\\r\\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid,\\r\\nO, speak!\\r\\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\\r\\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\\r\\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\\r\\n[The cock crows.]\\r\\nSpeak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.\\r\\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nDo, if it will not stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBer.\\r\\n'Tis here!\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\n'Tis here!\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.\\r\\n'Tis gone!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit Ghost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\\r\\nTo offer it the show of violence;\\r\\nFor it is, as the air, invulnerable,\\r\\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBer.\\r\\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nAnd then it started, like a guilty thing\\r\\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\\r\\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\\r\\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\\r\\nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\\r\\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\\r\\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\\r\\nTo his confine: and of the truth herein\\r\\nThis present object made probation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.\\r\\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\\r\\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\\r\\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\\r\\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\\r\\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;\\r\\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\\r\\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;\\r\\nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nSo have I heard, and do in part believe it.\\r\\nBut, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,\\r\\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:\\r\\nBreak we our watch up: and by my advice,\\r\\nLet us impart what we have seen to-night\\r\\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\\r\\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:\\r\\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\\r\\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.\\r\\nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know\\r\\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,\\r\\nCornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\\r\\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\\r\\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\\r\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe;\\r\\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\\r\\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\\r\\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\\r\\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\\r\\nTh' imperial jointress to this warlike state,\\r\\nHave we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--\\r\\nWith an auspicious and one dropping eye,\\r\\nWith mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,\\r\\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,--\\r\\nTaken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd\\r\\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\\r\\nWith this affair along:--or all, our thanks.\\r\\nNow follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,\\r\\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\\r\\nOr thinking by our late dear brother's death\\r\\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\\r\\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\\r\\nHe hath not fail'd to pester us with message,\\r\\nImporting the surrender of those lands\\r\\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\\r\\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him,--\\r\\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\\r\\nThus much the business is:--we have here writ\\r\\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--\\r\\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\\r\\nOf this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress\\r\\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\\r\\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\\r\\nOut of his subject:--and we here dispatch\\r\\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,\\r\\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway;\\r\\nGiving to you no further personal power\\r\\nTo business with the king, more than the scope\\r\\nOf these dilated articles allow.\\r\\nFarewell; and let your haste commend your duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nCor. and Volt.\\r\\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\\r\\nYou told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?\\r\\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\\r\\nAnd lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\\r\\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\\r\\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\\r\\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\\r\\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\\r\\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nDread my lord,\\r\\nYour leave and favour to return to France;\\r\\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark,\\r\\nTo show my duty in your coronation;\\r\\nYet now, I must confess, that duty done,\\r\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,\\r\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\\r\\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\\r\\nUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:\\r\\nI do beseech you, give him leave to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\\r\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!--\\r\\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\n[Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\\r\\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\\r\\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\\r\\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust:\\r\\nThou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,\\r\\nPassing through nature to eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAy, madam, it is common.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nIf it be,\\r\\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\\r\\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\\r\\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\\r\\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\\r\\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\\r\\nNor the dejected 'havior of the visage,\\r\\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\\r\\nThat can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;\\r\\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\\r\\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\\r\\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\\r\\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\\r\\nBut, you must know, your father lost a father;\\r\\nThat father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,\\r\\nIn filial obligation, for some term\\r\\nTo do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere\\r\\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\\r\\nOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;\\r\\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven;\\r\\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient;\\r\\nAn understanding simple and unschool'd;\\r\\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\\r\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\\r\\nWhy should we, in our peevish opposition,\\r\\nTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\\r\\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\\r\\nTo reason most absurd; whose common theme\\r\\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\\r\\nFrom the first corse till he that died to-day,\\r\\n'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth\\r\\nThis unprevailing woe; and think of us\\r\\nAs of a father: for let the world take note\\r\\nYou are the most immediate to our throne;\\r\\nAnd with no less nobility of love\\r\\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\\r\\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\\r\\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\\r\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\\r\\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\\r\\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\\r\\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:\\r\\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:\\r\\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;\\r\\nThis gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet\\r\\nSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,\\r\\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day\\r\\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;\\r\\nAnd the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\\r\\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nO that this too too solid flesh would melt,\\r\\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\\r\\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix'd\\r\\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!\\r\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\r\\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\\r\\nFie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\\r\\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\\r\\nPossess it merely.

This to me\\r\\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;\\r\\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch:\\r\\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\\r\\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\\r\\nThe apparition comes: I knew your father;\\r\\nThese hands are not more like.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBut where was this?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.\\r\\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDid you not speak to it?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nMy lord, I did;\\r\\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\\r\\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\\r\\nItself to motion, like as it would speak:\\r\\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\\r\\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\\r\\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\n'Tis very strange.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\\r\\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\\r\\nTo let you know of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\\r\\nHold you the watch to-night?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar. and Ber.\\r\\nWe do, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nArm'd, say you?\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth.\\r\\nArm'd, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nFrom top to toe?\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth.\\r\\nMy lord, from head to foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThen saw you not his face?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nO, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nPale or red?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nNay, very pale.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nMost constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI would I had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nIt would have much amaz'd you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nVery like, very like.

Perhaps he loves you now;\\r\\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\\r\\nThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,\\r\\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\\r\\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\\r\\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\\r\\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\\r\\nThe safety and health of this whole state;\\r\\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\\r\\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\\r\\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\\r\\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\\r\\nAs he in his particular act and place\\r\\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\\r\\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\\r\\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\\r\\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\\r\\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\\r\\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\\r\\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\\r\\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\\r\\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\\r\\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\\r\\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon:\\r\\nVirtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:\\r\\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\\r\\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd:\\r\\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\\r\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\r\\nBe wary then; best safety lies in fear:\\r\\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nI shall th' effect of this good lesson keep\\r\\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\\r\\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\\r\\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\\r\\nWhilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\\r\\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\\r\\nAnd recks not his own read.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nO, fear me not.\\r\\nI stay too long:--but here my father comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\r\\n\\r\\nA double blessing is a double grace;\\r\\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!\\r\\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\\r\\nAnd you are stay'd for.

Beware\\r\\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,\\r\\nBear't that the opposed may beware of thee.\\r\\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\\r\\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\\r\\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\\r\\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\\r\\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\\r\\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\\r\\nAre most select and generous chief in that.\\r\\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\\r\\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\\r\\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\r\\nThis above all,--to thine own self be true;\\r\\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\\r\\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\\r\\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nFarewell, Ophelia; and remember well\\r\\nWhat I have said to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\\r\\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nFarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nWhat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nMarry, well bethought:\\r\\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\\r\\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\\r\\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous;\\r\\nIf it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,\\r\\nAnd that in way of caution,--I must tell you\\r\\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\\r\\nAs it behooves my daughter and your honour.\\r\\nWhat is between you? give me up the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\\r\\nOf his affection to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nAffection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,\\r\\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\\r\\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nMarry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;\\r\\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\\r\\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\\r\\nOr,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\\r\\nWronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\\r\\nIn honourable fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\\r\\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks.

From this time\\r\\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\\r\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\\r\\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\\r\\nBelieve so much in him, that he is young;\\r\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\\r\\nThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,\\r\\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--\\r\\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\\r\\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\\r\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\\r\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all,--\\r\\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\\r\\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\\r\\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\\r\\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nI shall obey, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene IV.

O, most true; she is a\\r\\nstrumpet. What's the news?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThen is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me\\r\\nquestion more in particular: what have you, my good friends,\\r\\ndeserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison\\r\\nhither?\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nPrison, my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDenmark's a prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nThen is the world one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and\\r\\ndungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nWe think not so, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good\\r\\nor bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nWhy, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a\\r\\nking of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of\\r\\nthe ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that\\r\\nit is but a shadow's shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd\\r\\nheroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my\\r\\nfay, I cannot reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos. and Guild.\\r\\nWe'll wait upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my\\r\\nservants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most\\r\\ndreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what\\r\\nmake you at Elsinore?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:\\r\\nand sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were\\r\\nyou not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free\\r\\nvisitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nWhat should we say, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and\\r\\nthere is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties\\r\\nhave not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen\\r\\nhave sent for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nTo what end, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights\\r\\nof our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the\\r\\nobligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a\\r\\nbetter proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with\\r\\nme, whether you were sent for or no.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\n[To Guildenstern.] What say you?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\n[Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold\\r\\nnot off.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your\\r\\ndiscovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no\\r\\nfeather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my\\r\\nmirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so\\r\\nheavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,\\r\\nseems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the\\r\\nair, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical\\r\\nroof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing\\r\\nto me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a\\r\\npiece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in\\r\\nfaculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in\\r\\naction how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the\\r\\nbeauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what\\r\\nis this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman\\r\\nneither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten\\r\\nentertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them\\r\\non the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall\\r\\nhave tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and\\r\\ntarget; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall\\r\\nend his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\\r\\nlungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind\\r\\nfreely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are\\r\\nthey?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in,--the\\r\\ntragedians of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both in\\r\\nreputation and profit, was better both ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late\\r\\ninnovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the\\r\\ncity? Are they so followed?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nNo, indeed, are they not.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,\\r\\nsir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top\\r\\nof question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are\\r\\nnow the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call\\r\\nthem,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and\\r\\ndare scarce come thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they\\r\\nescoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can\\r\\nsing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow\\r\\nthemselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means\\r\\nare no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim\\r\\nagainst their own succession?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation\\r\\nholds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for\\r\\nawhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player\\r\\nwent to cuffs in the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIs't possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and\\r\\nthose that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give\\r\\ntwenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in\\r\\nlittle. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if\\r\\nphilosophy could find it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flourish of trumpets within.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nThere are the players.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the\\r\\nappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply\\r\\nwith you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I\\r\\ntell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like\\r\\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father\\r\\nand aunt-mother are deceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I\\r\\nknow a hawk from a handsaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that\\r\\ngreat baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old\\r\\nman is twice a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You\\r\\nsay right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in\\r\\nRome,--\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBuzz, buzz!\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nUpon my honour,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThen came each actor on his ass,--\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,\\r\\nhistory, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,\\r\\ntragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene\\r\\nindividable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor\\r\\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are\\r\\nthe only men.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy--\\r\\n   'One fair daughter, and no more,\\r\\n   The which he loved passing well.'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\n[Aside.] Still on my daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I\\r\\nlove passing well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNay, that follows not.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nWhat follows, then, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy--\\r\\n   'As by lot, God wot,'\\r\\nand then, you know,\\r\\n   'It came to pass, as most like it was--'\\r\\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look\\r\\nwhere my abridgment comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter four or five Players.]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee\\r\\nwell.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is\\r\\nvalanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in\\r\\nDenmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your\\r\\nladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\\r\\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of\\r\\nuncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are\\r\\nall welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at\\r\\nanything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a\\r\\ntaste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;\\r\\nor if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased\\r\\nnot the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I\\r\\nreceived it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in\\r\\nthe top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,\\r\\nset down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said\\r\\nthere were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,\\r\\nnor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of\\r\\naffectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\\r\\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it\\r\\nI chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\\r\\nespecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in\\r\\nyour memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--\\r\\n\\r\\nit is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,\\r\\n   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\\r\\n   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--\\r\\n   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\\r\\n   With heraldry more dismal; head to foot\\r\\n   Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd\\r\\n   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\r\\n   Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\\r\\n   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light\\r\\n   To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,\\r\\n   And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\\r\\n   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\r\\n   Old grandsire Priam seeks.'\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, proceed you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good\\r\\ndiscretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\n   Anon he finds him,\\r\\n   Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,\\r\\n   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\r\\n   Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,\\r\\n   Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\\r\\n   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\r\\n   The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\r\\n   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\r\\n   Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash\\r\\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,\\r\\n   Which was declining on the milky head\\r\\n   Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\\r\\n   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;\\r\\n   And, like a neutral to his will and matter,\\r\\n   Did nothing.\\r\\n   But as we often see, against some storm,\\r\\n   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\r\\n   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\\r\\n   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\r\\n   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\\r\\n   A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;\\r\\n   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\\r\\n   On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\\r\\n   With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\\r\\n   Now falls on Priam.--\\r\\n   Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\\r\\n   In general synod, take away her power;\\r\\n   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\r\\n   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\r\\n   As low as to the fiends!\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nThis is too long.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--\\r\\nHe's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come\\r\\nto Hecuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\n   But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\n'The mobled queen'?\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nThat's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\n   Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\\r\\n   With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\\r\\n   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\r\\n   About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\\r\\n   A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--\\r\\n   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\\r\\n   'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:\\r\\n   But if the gods themselves did see her then,\\r\\n   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\r\\n   In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\\r\\n   The instant burst of clamour that she made,--\\r\\n   Unless things mortal move them not at all,--\\r\\n   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\r\\n   And passion in the gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nLook, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's\\r\\neyes.--Pray you, no more!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\n'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--\\r\\nGood my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you\\r\\nhear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief\\r\\nchronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a\\r\\nbad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nOdd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his\\r\\ndesert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own\\r\\nhonour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in\\r\\nyour bounty. Take them in.\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nCome, sirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of\\r\\nGonzago'?\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\nAy, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a\\r\\nspeech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and\\r\\ninsert in't? could you not?\\r\\n\\r\\nI Play.\\r\\nAy, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nVery well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit First Player.]\\r\\n\\r\\n--My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till\\r\\nnight: you are welcome to Elsinore.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nGood my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAy, so, God b' wi' ye!\\r\\nNow I am alone.\\r\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\r\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\r\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\r\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\r\\nThat from her working all his visage wan'd;\\r\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\\r\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\r\\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\\r\\nFor Hecuba?\\r\\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\r\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\\r\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\r\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\r\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\\r\\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free;\\r\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,\\r\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\\r\\nYet I,\\r\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\\r\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\r\\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king\\r\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\r\\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\r\\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\\r\\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\\r\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat\\r\\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?\\r\\n'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\\r\\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall\\r\\nTo make oppression bitter; or ere this\\r\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\r\\nWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\\r\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\\r\\nO, vengeance!\\r\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\r\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\\r\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\r\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\\r\\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\\r\\nA scullion!\\r\\nFie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard\\r\\nThat guilty creatures, sitting at a play,\\r\\nHave by the very cunning of the scene\\r\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\r\\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;\\r\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\r\\nWith most miraculous organ, I'll have these players\\r\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\r\\nBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\\r\\nI'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\\r\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\r\\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\\r\\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\\r\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,--\\r\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,--\\r\\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\\r\\nMore relative than this.--the play's the thing\\r\\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III.\\r\\n\\r\\nScene I.

To die,--to sleep;--\\r\\nTo sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;\\r\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\r\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\r\\nMust give us pause: there's the respect\\r\\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\\r\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\r\\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\\r\\nThe pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,\\r\\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\\r\\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\\r\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\r\\nWith a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,\\r\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\r\\nBut that the dread of something after death,--\\r\\nThe undiscover'd country, from whose bourn\\r\\nNo traveller returns,--puzzles the will,\\r\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\r\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\r\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\\r\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\r\\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;\\r\\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\\r\\nWith this regard, their currents turn awry,\\r\\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\\r\\nThe fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons\\r\\nBe all my sins remember'd.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nGood my lord,\\r\\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\\r\\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\\r\\nI pray you, now receive them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNo, not I;\\r\\nI never gave you aught.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did;\\r\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd\\r\\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\\r\\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\\r\\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\\r\\nThere, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHa, ha! are you honest?\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nMy lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAre you fair?\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nWhat means your lordship?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no\\r\\ndiscourse to your beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform\\r\\nhonesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can\\r\\ntranslate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,\\r\\nbut now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nYou should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so\\r\\ninoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nI was the more deceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nGet thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of\\r\\nsinners?

What should such fellows as I\\r\\ndo crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;\\r\\nbelieve none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.

To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.\\r\\nFarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nOph.\\r\\nO heavenly powers, restore him!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath\\r\\ngiven you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you\\r\\namble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your\\r\\nwantonness your ignorance.

A hall in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,\\r\\ntrippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your\\r\\nplayers do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do\\r\\nnot saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all\\r\\ngently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\\r\\nwhirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a\\r\\ntemperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the\\r\\nsoul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\\r\\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,\\r\\nfor the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb\\r\\nshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing\\r\\nTermagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Player.\\r\\nI warrant your honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your\\r\\ntutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with\\r\\nthis special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of\\r\\nnature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,\\r\\nwhose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as\\r\\n'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,\\r\\nscorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his\\r\\nform and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though\\r\\nit make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious\\r\\ngrieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,\\r\\no'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I\\r\\nhave seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not\\r\\nto speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of\\r\\nChristians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so\\r\\nstrutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's\\r\\njourneymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated\\r\\nhumanity so abominably.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Player.\\r\\nI hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nO, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns\\r\\nspeak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them\\r\\nthat will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren\\r\\nspectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\\r\\nquestion of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous\\r\\nand shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go\\r\\nmake you ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Players.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?\\r\\n\\r\\nPol.\\r\\nAnd the queen too, and that presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBid the players make haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit Polonius.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you two help to hasten them?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos. and Guil.\\r\\nWe will, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat, ho, Horatio!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Horatio.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\\r\\nAs e'er my conversation cop'd withal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nO, my dear lord,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNay, do not think I flatter;\\r\\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee,\\r\\nThat no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,\\r\\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?\\r\\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;\\r\\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\\r\\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\\r\\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice,\\r\\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\\r\\nHath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been\\r\\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;\\r\\nA man that Fortune's buffets and rewards\\r\\nHast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those\\r\\nWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled\\r\\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger\\r\\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\\r\\nThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\\r\\nIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\\r\\nAs I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\\r\\nThere is a play to-night before the king;\\r\\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance,\\r\\nWhich I have told thee, of my father's death:\\r\\nI pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,\\r\\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\\r\\nObserve mine uncle: if his occulted guilt\\r\\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\\r\\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen;\\r\\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\\r\\nAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;\\r\\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face;\\r\\nAnd, after, we will both our judgments join\\r\\nIn censure of his seeming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nWell, my lord:\\r\\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,\\r\\nAnd scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThey are coming to the play.

Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a\\r\\nsuit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten\\r\\nyet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life\\r\\nhalf a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else\\r\\nshall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose\\r\\nepitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'\\r\\n\\r\\n[Trumpets sound.

The cease of majesty\\r\\nDies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw\\r\\nWhat's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,\\r\\nFix'd on the summit of the highest mount,\\r\\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\\r\\nAre mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,\\r\\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\\r\\nAttends the boisterous ruin.

Whereto serves mercy\\r\\nBut to confront the visage of offence?\\r\\nAnd what's in prayer but this twofold force,--\\r\\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\\r\\nOr pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;\\r\\nMy fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\\r\\nCan serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--\\r\\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess'd\\r\\nOf those effects for which I did the murder,--\\r\\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\\r\\nMay one be pardon'd and retain the offence?\\r\\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\\r\\nOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice;\\r\\nAnd oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\\r\\nBuys out the law; but 'tis not so above;\\r\\nThere is no shuffling;--there the action lies\\r\\nIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,\\r\\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\\r\\nTo give in evidence.

Have you eyes?\\r\\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\\r\\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\\r\\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\\r\\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\\r\\nAnd waits upon the judgment: and what judgment\\r\\nWould step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,\\r\\nElse could you not have motion: but sure that sense\\r\\nIs apoplex'd; for madness would not err;\\r\\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd\\r\\nBut it reserv'd some quantity of choice\\r\\nTo serve in such a difference.

Rebellious hell,\\r\\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\\r\\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\\r\\nAnd melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame\\r\\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\\r\\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\\r\\nAnd reason panders will.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nO Hamlet, speak no more:\\r\\nThou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;\\r\\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\\r\\nAs will not leave their tinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNay, but to live\\r\\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\\r\\nStew'd in corruption, honeying and making love\\r\\nOver the nasty sty,--\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nO, speak to me no more;\\r\\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\\r\\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nA murderer and a villain;\\r\\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\\r\\nOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings;\\r\\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\\r\\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\\r\\nAnd put it in his pocket!\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nNo more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nA king of shreds and patches!--\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSave me and hover o'er me with your wings,\\r\\nYou heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nAlas, he's mad!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\\r\\nThat, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by\\r\\nThe important acting of your dread command?\\r\\nO, say!\\r\\n\\r\\nGhost.\\r\\nDo not forget. This visitation\\r\\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\\r\\nBut, look, amazement on thy mother sits:\\r\\nO, step between her and her fighting soul,--\\r\\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--\\r\\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHow is it with you, lady?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nAlas, how is't with you,\\r\\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\\r\\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\\r\\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;\\r\\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\\r\\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\\r\\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\\r\\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\\r\\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!\\r\\nHis form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,\\r\\nWould make them capable.--Do not look upon me;\\r\\nLest with this piteous action you convert\\r\\nMy stern effects: then what I have to do\\r\\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nTo whom do you speak this?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDo you see nothing there?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNor did you nothing hear?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\\r\\nMy father, in his habit as he liv'd!\\r\\nLook, where he goes, even now out at the portal!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit Ghost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nThis is the very coinage of your brain:\\r\\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\\r\\nIs very cunning in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nEcstasy!\\r\\nMy pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,\\r\\nAnd makes as healthful music: it is not madness\\r\\nThat I have utter'd: bring me to the test,\\r\\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\\r\\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\\r\\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\\r\\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks:\\r\\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\\r\\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\\r\\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;\\r\\nRepent what's past; avoid what is to come;\\r\\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\\r\\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\\r\\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\\r\\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\\r\\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nO, throw away the worser part of it,\\r\\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\\r\\nGood night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;\\r\\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\\r\\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\\r\\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,--\\r\\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\\r\\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\\r\\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;\\r\\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\\r\\nTo the next abstinence: the next more easy;\\r\\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\\r\\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\\r\\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:\\r\\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles'd,\\r\\nI'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord\\r\\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\\r\\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,\\r\\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\\r\\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\\r\\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\\r\\nThe death I gave him. So again, good-night.--\\r\\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\\r\\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--\\r\\nOne word more, good lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nWhat shall I do?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\\r\\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed;\\r\\nPinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;\\r\\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\\r\\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,\\r\\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\\r\\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\\r\\nBut mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;\\r\\nFor who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\\r\\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\\r\\nSuch dear concernings hide? who would do so?\\r\\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\\r\\nUnpeg the basket on the house's top,\\r\\nLet the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,\\r\\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\\r\\nAnd break your own neck down.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nBe thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,\\r\\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\\r\\nWhat thou hast said to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI must to England; you know that?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nAlack,\\r\\nI had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--\\r\\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--\\r\\nThey bear the mandate; they must sweep my way\\r\\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\\r\\nFor 'tis the sport to have the enginer\\r\\nHoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard\\r\\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\\r\\nAnd blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,\\r\\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.--\\r\\nThis man shall set me packing:\\r\\nI'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--\\r\\nMother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor\\r\\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\\r\\nWho was in life a foolish peating knave.\\r\\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--\\r\\nGood night, mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nScene I. A room in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nThere's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves\\r\\nYou must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.\\r\\nWhere is your son?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nBestow this place on us a little while.\\r\\n\\r\\n[To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nWhat, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nMad as the sea and wind, when both contend\\r\\nWhich is the mightier: in his lawless fit\\r\\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\\r\\nWhips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'\\r\\nAnd in this brainish apprehension, kills\\r\\nThe unseen good old man.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nO heavy deed!\\r\\nIt had been so with us, had we been there:\\r\\nHis liberty is full of threats to all;\\r\\nTo you yourself, to us, to every one.\\r\\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?\\r\\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\\r\\nShould have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt\\r\\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love\\r\\nWe would not understand what was most fit;\\r\\nBut, like the owner of a foul disease,\\r\\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\\r\\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen.\\r\\nTo draw apart the body he hath kill'd:\\r\\nO'er whom his very madness, like some ore\\r\\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\\r\\nShows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nO Gertrude, come away!\\r\\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\\r\\nBut we will ship him hence: and this vile deed\\r\\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\\r\\nBoth countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid:\\r\\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\\r\\nAnd from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:\\r\\nGo seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body\\r\\nInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;\\r\\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\\r\\nAnd what's untimely done: so haply slander,--\\r\\nWhose whisper o'er the world's diameter,\\r\\nAs level as the cannon to his blank,\\r\\nTransports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,\\r\\nAnd hit the woundless air.--O, come away!\\r\\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt.]\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II.

Besides, to be\\r\\ndemanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son\\r\\nof a king?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nTake you me for a sponge, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAy, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,\\r\\nhis authorities. But such officers do the king best service in\\r\\nthe end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;\\r\\nfirst mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have\\r\\ngleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nI understand you not, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nMy lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to\\r\\nthe king.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThe body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.\\r\\nThe king is a thing,--\\r\\n\\r\\nGuil.\\r\\nA thing, my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nOf nothing: bring me to him.

Another room in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter King,attended.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\\r\\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\\r\\nYet must not we put the strong law on him:\\r\\nHe's lov'd of the distracted multitude,\\r\\nWho like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\\r\\nAnd where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,\\r\\nBut never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,\\r\\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\\r\\nDeliberate pause: diseases desperate grown\\r\\nBy desperate appliance are reliev'd,\\r\\nOr not at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Rosencrantz.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now! what hath befall'n?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nWhere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,\\r\\nWe cannot get from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nBut where is he?\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nBring him before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nRos.\\r\\nHo, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nNow, Hamlet, where's Polonius?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAt supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nAt supper! where?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNot where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain\\r\\nconvocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your\\r\\nonly emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and\\r\\nwe fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar\\r\\nis but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's\\r\\nthe end.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nAlas, alas!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat\\r\\nof the fish that hath fed of that worm.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nWhat dost thou mean by this?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through\\r\\nthe guts of a beggar.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nWhere is Polonius?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIn heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not\\r\\nthere, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you\\r\\nfind him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up\\r\\nthe stairs into the lobby.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nGo seek him there. [To some Attendants.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHe will stay till you come.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Attendants.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--\\r\\nWhich we do tender, as we dearly grieve\\r\\nFor that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence\\r\\nWith fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;\\r\\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\\r\\nThe associates tend, and everything is bent\\r\\nFor England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nFor England!\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nAy, Hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nGood.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--\\r\\nFarewell, dear mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nThy loving father, Hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nMy mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is\\r\\none flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;\\r\\nDelay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:\\r\\nAway! for everything is seal'd and done\\r\\nThat else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--\\r\\nAs my great power thereof may give thee sense,\\r\\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\\r\\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\\r\\nPays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set\\r\\nOur sovereign process; which imports at full,\\r\\nBy letters conjuring to that effect,\\r\\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;\\r\\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\\r\\nAnd thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,\\r\\nHowe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene IV.

Go a little before.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow all occasions do inform against me\\r\\nAnd spur my dull revenge! What is a man,\\r\\nIf his chief good and market of his time\\r\\nBe but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.\\r\\nSure he that made us with such large discourse,\\r\\nLooking before and after, gave us not\\r\\nThat capability and godlike reason\\r\\nTo fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be\\r\\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\\r\\nOf thinking too precisely on the event,--\\r\\nA thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\\r\\nAnd ever three parts coward,--I do not know\\r\\nWhy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'\\r\\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\\r\\nTo do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:\\r\\nWitness this army, of such mass and charge,\\r\\nLed by a delicate and tender prince;\\r\\nWhose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,\\r\\nMakes mouths at the invisible event;\\r\\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\\r\\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\\r\\nEven for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great\\r\\nIs not to stir without great argument,\\r\\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\\r\\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,\\r\\nThat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\\r\\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\\r\\nAnd let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see\\r\\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\\r\\nThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\\r\\nGo to their graves like beds; fight for a plot\\r\\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\\r\\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\\r\\nTo hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,\\r\\nMy thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene V.

They say the owl was a baker's daughter.\\r\\nLord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.

They have dealt with me like thieves\\r\\nof mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for\\r\\nthem. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou\\r\\nto me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words\\r\\nto speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\\r\\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring\\r\\nthee where I am.

The other motive,\\r\\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\\r\\nIs the great love the general gender bear him;\\r\\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\\r\\nWould, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\\r\\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\\r\\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\\r\\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\\r\\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nAnd so have I a noble father lost;\\r\\nA sister driven into desperate terms,--\\r\\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\\r\\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\\r\\nFor her perfections:--but my revenge will come.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nBreak not your sleeps for that:--you must not think\\r\\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\\r\\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\\r\\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:\\r\\nI lov'd your father, and we love ourself;\\r\\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter a Messenger.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now!

Sir, this report of his\\r\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\r\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\r\\nYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.\\r\\nNow, out of this,--\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nWhat out of this, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\r\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\r\\nA face without a heart?\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nWhy ask you this?\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nNot that I think you did not love your father;\\r\\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\\r\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\r\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\r\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\r\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\\r\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\\r\\nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,\\r\\nDies in his own too much: that we would do,\\r\\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\\r\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\r\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\r\\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,\\r\\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--\\r\\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\\r\\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed\\r\\nMore than in words?\\r\\n\\r\\nLaer.\\r\\nTo cut his throat i' the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing.\\r\\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\\r\\nRevenge should have no bounds.

Hum! This fellow might be in's time a\\r\\ngreat buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his\\r\\nfines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of\\r\\nhis fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine\\r\\npate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of\\r\\nhis purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth\\r\\nof a pair of indentures?

'a pour'd a flagon of\\r\\nRhenish on my head once.

[Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,\\r\\nHoratio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he\\r\\nhath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred\\r\\nin my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those\\r\\nlips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes\\r\\nnow? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that\\r\\nwere wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your\\r\\nown grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's\\r\\nchamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this\\r\\nfavour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,\\r\\ntell me one thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nWhat's that, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nE'en so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAnd smelt so? Pah!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Throws down the skull.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nE'en so, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not\\r\\nimagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it\\r\\nstopping a bung-hole?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\n'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNo, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty\\r\\nenough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,\\r\\nAlexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is\\r\\nearth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he\\r\\nwas converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?\\r\\n   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\\r\\n   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.\\r\\n   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe\\r\\n   Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!\\r\\nBut soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,\\r\\nLaertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?\\r\\nAnd with such maimed rites?

A hall in the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSo much for this, sir: now let me see the other;\\r\\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nRemember it, my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\\r\\nThat would not let me sleep: methought I lay\\r\\nWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,\\r\\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,\\r\\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well,\\r\\nWhen our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us\\r\\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,\\r\\nRough-hew them how we will.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nThat is most certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nUp from my cabin,\\r\\nMy sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark\\r\\nGrop'd I to find out them: had my desire;\\r\\nFinger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew\\r\\nTo mine own room again: making so bold,\\r\\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\\r\\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\\r\\nO royal knavery! an exact command,--\\r\\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons,\\r\\nImporting Denmark's health, and England's too,\\r\\nWith, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--\\r\\nThat, on the supervise, no leisure bated,\\r\\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\\r\\nMy head should be struck off.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nIs't possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHere's the commission: read it at more leisure.\\r\\nBut wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nI beseech you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nBeing thus benetted round with villanies,--\\r\\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\\r\\nThey had begun the play,--I sat me down;\\r\\nDevis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:\\r\\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\\r\\nA baseness to write fair, and labour'd much\\r\\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\\r\\nIt did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know\\r\\nThe effect of what I wrote?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nAy, good my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nAn earnest conjuration from the king,--\\r\\nAs England was his faithful tributary;\\r\\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish;\\r\\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\\r\\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities;\\r\\nAnd many such-like as's of great charge,--\\r\\nThat, on the view and know of these contents,\\r\\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\\r\\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\\r\\nNot shriving-time allow'd.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nHow was this seal'd?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\\r\\nI had my father's signet in my purse,\\r\\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal:\\r\\nFolded the writ up in the form of the other;\\r\\nSubscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,\\r\\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\\r\\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\\r\\nThou know'st already.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment;\\r\\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\\r\\nDoes by their own insinuation grow:\\r\\n'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\\r\\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\\r\\nOf mighty opposites.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nWhy, what a king is this!\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nDoes it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--\\r\\nHe that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;\\r\\nPopp'd in between the election and my hopes;\\r\\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\\r\\nAnd with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience\\r\\nTo quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd\\r\\nTo let this canker of our nature come\\r\\nIn further evil?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\\r\\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIt will be short: the interim is mine;\\r\\nAnd a man's life is no more than to say One.\\r\\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\\r\\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\\r\\nFor by the image of my cause I see\\r\\nThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:\\r\\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\\r\\nInto a towering passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nPeace; who comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter Osric.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nNo, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He\\r\\nhath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and\\r\\nhis crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I\\r\\nsay, spacious in the possession of dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should\\r\\nimpart a thing to you from his majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your\\r\\nbonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nI thank your lordship, t'is very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nMethinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot\\r\\ntell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that\\r\\nhe has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the\\r\\nmatter,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI beseech you, remember,--\\r\\n[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nNay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here\\r\\nis newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute\\r\\ngentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft\\r\\nsociety and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he\\r\\nis the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the\\r\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I\\r\\nknow, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of\\r\\nmemory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.\\r\\nBut, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\\r\\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make\\r\\ntrue diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else\\r\\nwould trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more\\r\\nrawer breath?\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nSir?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,\\r\\nsir, really.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nOf Laertes?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nOf him, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nI know, you are not ignorant,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not\\r\\nmuch approve me.--Well, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in\\r\\nexcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on\\r\\nhim by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat's his weapon?\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nRapier and dagger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThat's two of his weapons:--but well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nThe king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:\\r\\nagainst the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French\\r\\nrapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and\\r\\nso: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,\\r\\nvery responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of\\r\\nvery liberal conceit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nWhat call you the carriages?\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could\\r\\ncarry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.\\r\\nBut, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their\\r\\nassigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French\\r\\nbet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nThe king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between\\r\\nyour and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath\\r\\nlaid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial\\r\\nif your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHow if I answer no?\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,\\r\\nit is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be\\r\\nbrought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,\\r\\nI will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my\\r\\nshame and the odd hits.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsr.\\r\\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nYours, yours.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit Osric.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else\\r\\nfor's turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and\\r\\nmany more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--\\r\\nonly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;\\r\\na kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and\\r\\nthrough the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow\\r\\nthem to their trial, the bubbles are out,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Enter a Lord.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLord.\\r\\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,\\r\\nwho brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends\\r\\nto know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you\\r\\nwill take longer time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:\\r\\nif his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided\\r\\nI be so able as now.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord.\\r\\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nIn happy time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord.\\r\\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to\\r\\nLaertes before you fall to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nShe well instructs me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Exit Lord.]\\r\\n\\r\\nHor.\\r\\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam.\\r\\nI do not think so; since he went into France I have been in\\r\\ncontinual practice: I shall win at the odds.
